# Image-Compression
Implementing K-means algorithm and using it for image compression.

The Project involves importing an image from local computer and applied the KMeans function from sklearn.cluster. I have compressed a 4096 X 2764 image of Stranger Things wallpaper and it executed quite well. Although, the original code for clustering without the use of Scikit Learn-KMeans might have been used, I will attach the code separately in another .ipynb file with this project.
